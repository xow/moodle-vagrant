Moodle Vagrant
==============

Virtualised development environments for Moodle.

The goal is to create a one hit way of creating and destroying disposable dev environments for Moodle.

For the time being it will be most useful for windows based systems that cannot use MDK.

The goal will be to create a system that can launch VMs for any OS and database combination without having to set it up on a local machine first. This will be limited by licenses however.
